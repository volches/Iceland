			"text2": "In Icelandic fjall means 'mountain', and there is a 340-meter mountain framing the beach with unique hexagonal basalt columns at its base which erupted in the penultimate Ice Age under the glacier. Puffins love this mountain and comes here every year to breed. Mountain offers beautiful views of Reynisfjara black beach and a cute town of VÃ­k. The peak of Reynisfjall is best known for towering beside two of the most popular sites of the South, Reynisfjara and Reynisdrangar. With its enormous basalt stacks, roaring Atlantic waves, and stunning panoramas, Reynisfjara is widely considered to be the most beautiful example of Iceland's black sand beaches. In 1991, National Geographic voted Reynisfjara as one of the Top 10 non-tropical beaches to visit on the planet. Upon visiting the beach, travelers will immediately observe rocky sea stacks sitting off the shoreline, known as Reynisdrangar. According to local folklore, these large basalt columns were once trolls trying to pull ships from the ocean to shore. However, these trolls were dim and went out too late in the night; dawn broke on the horizon, turning the trolls into solid stone. Another legend tells of a husband whose wife was kidnapped and killed by two trolls. The man followed the trolls down to Reynisfjara where he froze them, ensuring that they would never kill again.",

Puffins love this mountain and comes here every year to breed. Mountain offers beautiful views of Reynisfjara black beach and a cute town of Vík. The peak of Reynisfjall is best known for towering beside two of the most popular sites of the South, Reynisfjara and Reynisdrangar. With its enormous basalt stacks, roaring Atlantic waves, and stunning panoramas, Reynisfjara is widely considered to be the most beautiful example of Iceland's black sand beaches. In 1991, National Geographic voted Reynisfjara as one of the Top 10 non-tropical beaches to visit on the planet. Upon visiting the beach, travelers will immediately observe rocky sea stacks sitting off the shoreline, known as Reynisdrangar. According to local folklore, these large basalt columns were once trolls trying to pull ships from the ocean to shore. However, these trolls were dim and went out too late in the night; dawn broke on the horizon, turning the trolls into solid stone. Another legend tells of a husband whose wife was kidnapped and killed by two trolls. The man followed the trolls down to Reynisfjara where he froze them, ensuring that they would never kill again.",

				<p>What does Reynisfjara mean?</p>
				<p>
				  The word fjara in Icelandic means 'beach'. And according to the
				  Internet (there aren't many reputable sources out there with this
				  information), the name Reynisfjara comes from a wealthy Norwegian
				  man called Reynira, who was the first settler of this area of
				  Iceland. So Reynisfjara literally translates to 'Reynira's beach.
				</p>
				<p>
				  The waves at Reynisfjara are known for their volatility and
				  unpredictability, and it is important to be aware of the risks
				  involved with getting too close to them while exploring the beach.
				  The roaring waves of Reynisfjara are extremely strong and often
				  push a lot further up the beach than one might expect. When they
				  pull back away from the beach, their force is even stronger, and
				  they are well capable of dragging unfortunate people away with
				  them.

The formations are the remains of large and imposing sea cliffs, made up of basalt, that serve as a vital part of the area's allure; they shoot dramatically out of the ocean under the looming cliffs of Mt.

At any time of year, and in any light, this is a place of great beauty which will remind people that they can never be far from the powerful forces of nature which shaped the island of Iceland. Marvel at the power of the ocean but do not stand too close – those masterful waves deserve your respect and can be quite dangerous if you get too close! The reason for the sand at Reynisfjara being black is that it is formed from heavily eroded volcanic rocks (also known as extrusive igneous rocks), which are black (or obsidian) to begin with as they have been formed from cooled lava which turns black as it cools and hardens.",

Make a stop at the town of Vik as you travel along the Ring Road in South Iceland! Vik i Myrdal is a common stop along the South Coast, with excellent restaurants and all the basic services one might need, including a supermarket, a swimming pool, and a gas station.The village is located at a very volcanically active area and as mentioned before the powerful Katla nests in a nearby glacier. This is where the whims of nature, such as volcanoes, have had a huge influence. It's been said that if Katla would erupt, the glacier meltwater would likely go over most houses in the village with the exception of the mighty church."

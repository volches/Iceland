			"text1": "One of the best places for hiking in Iceland is Thorsmork Valley. The Thorsmork hiking trail offers the optimal experience to see the distinct seasonal scenery in Iceland. From the budding spring and leafy summer to colorful autumn and snowy winter, the mountain top will give you a panoramic view of the glaciers, rivers, and streams glistering against the black sand in the sun, and the Icelandic plants. The acclaimed “Valley of Thor” is nothing but splendid. Located in the Southern Highlands, Thorsmork is about 150 km from Reykjavik and 100 km from Selfoss. When driving over gravelly terrain as you do in the Highlands, it is vital to have a capable automobile and an experienced driver. Self-driving requires a 4X4 vehicle with river crossing insurance coverage. Booked tours usually take on the adventure with a super jeep. Anyone visiting the valley will need a similar vehicle to cross the powerful Krossá River.",
			"text2": "Hiking in Thorsmork can be challenging but exciting at the same time. Available from April to October, the Fimmvorduhals trail is popular for running events and hiking tours. It's best to dress in layers with a wool base and pack some energy bars when you hike in Iceland. The weather can be unpredictable with the elevation gain, so it's best to make sure you pack accordingly.",
			"text3": "On your way to Thorsmork, you will also be able to take a glance at the famous volcano Eyjafjallajökull, which interrupted European and international air travel in 2010. Two new craters, Magni and Móði, were created that year near this area. They were named after the sons of Thor. The Seljalandsfoss waterfall, one of the most photogenic streams in Iceland, will also be on your route. These are all part of what you will see when you are hiking or trekking in Thorsmork Valley – the Icelandic geographic miracle.",

Located in Southern Iceland, the 190 km drive from Reykjavik requires a 4WD vehicle that will eventually be necessary to power through this mountainous area. Laugavegur hiking trail is most popular among both local and international hikers. Every summer, you will see backpackers trekking on this route with the incomparable landscape passing on both sides. One of the wonderful things about this area is that you can choose from short, beginner-level hikes, or opt for an all-out rugged Icelandic trekking tour.",
			"text2": "The Brennisteinsalda Mountain “Sulphur Wave” trail is another iconic route. The two-hour hike is never monotonous marching on a tundra. The juxtaposition of greenish moss and maroon hills with the backdrop of dark lava and ash fields transforms this hike into an intense visual treat. The well-known Laugahraun lava field with its lustrous colors and rough texture is a must-visit. This path is on top of the hiking trail recommendation in Iceland. Next to Mt.Brennisteinsalda is Mt. Blahnjukur, known for the Blue Peak trail, it leads the hikers all the way up to the 940m top where five glaciers are visible on a good, clear day.",
			"text3": "In addition to several other trails in this area, the Landmannalaugar Highland region provides a paradise where you will witness nature's miraculous design. The tours can be either a one-day hike or a multi-day trek. Also, always remember to bring your bathing suit. The abundant natural hot springs in this area will welcome you with a therapeutic treatment after a long day of hiking. There are many possible and wonderful routes when you hike in Iceland, and the Landmannalaugar hiking trails are without a doubt amongst the most precious ones. If you are a hiking fiend who has come this far from another time zone to visit Iceland, then it is inexcusable that you miss this land of untouched nature.",

The legend says that there was once a woman troll passing through the area who was turned into stone by the morning sun. You can still see her column while hiking through the area.",

Kerlingarfjöll is approximately 10,000 years old and was formed as a result of volcanic activity in the region. This area offers a beautiful mixture of geothermal hot springs and colorful rhyolite mountains. Kerlingarfjöll is often compared to the famous Landmannalaugar, a hiking area with rhyolite mountains. If you're looking for a less popular (but still beautiful) option, the Kerlingarfjöll hiking tour might be the perfect choice!",

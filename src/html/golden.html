The Golden Circle route in Iceland is the perfect introduction to the unique and remarkable natural wonders of the country. This iconic route spans 190 miles through Iceland's unforgettable nature bringing you some of the most spectacular landscapes and adventures, with plenty of opportunities for relaxation in-between. The name golden circle has derived from the term “Gullfoss” which means golden waterfall. This place is generally preferred by the majority of tourists. If you want to visit Iceland, then we can say that Iceland is popular in this place. It takes around 300 kilometers to visit from Reykjavík to the southern uplands of Iceland. The region is popular for travel-related tours and excursions in Iceland. The Golden Circle Tour from a long time has been popular among visitors to Iceland for its most popular natural wonders of South Iceland, Geysir geyser, Gullfoss waterfall, and the majestic Pingvellir. You will also find many volcanoes and glaciers while traveling through this route. The last route is Gullfoss waterfall where you will be allowed to travel free of cost. Besides these 3 popular places, you will find other routes also such as Kerio volcanic crater, the town of skalholt cathedral and Nesjavellir.",

				  The Golden Circle consists of three equally stunning locations in

				<ul>
				  <li>Thingvellir National Park</li>
				  <li>The Geysir Geothermal Area</li>
				  <li>Gullfoss Waterfall</li>

It has the honor of being the first of Iceland's three national parks to be established. It's also the only one that has been granted UNESCO World Heritage Site status. The park is only 29 miles (47 kilometers) from Reykjavik. It's a place where dramatic geology meets a millennium of fascinating history. Here, visitors to Thingvellir can discover the roots of this island's formation and how the Icelandic settlers formed their leaderless society.The park's unique geology comes from its location between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates, which create the rift valley that runs through Iceland.",

Steaming vents and chimneys are visible along the way and notably concentrated in the village of Laugarvatn, located halfway between Thingvellir and Geysir. This settlement has a spa heated by hot water currents beneath the ground's surface. Its steam rooms sit on top of bubbling hot pots that reach a sweltering 140 F (60 C). However, at Haukadalur valley, this geothermal activity becomes even more intense. Visitors can see the steam rising from miles away. Many hot pools, clay pots, and fumaroles dot the area. Minerals vividly color the hills and soil.",

Visitors can find the waterfall less than ten minutes down the road from Geysir. This powerful waterfall is located in a plunging, ancient valley and tumbles down two drops from an overall height of 105 feet (32 meters). During its heaviest flow in the summer, it pours an average of 4,944 cubic feet (140 cubic meters) of water every second. Gullfoss is not only known for its breathtaking power but also for the rainbows that appear above the falls like a multicolor crown on a sunny day."

          Why Iceland? Because there's nowhere else like it! Iceland
          is a land of fire and ice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iceland is a haven for nature lovers, with glaciers,
          waterfalls, hot springs, and lava fields just waiting to be
          explored. There are also plenty of cultural highlights to
          uncover in the capital city of Reykjavik and beyond.
        </p>

          Iceland is perfect for leisure travelers, families, and
          outdoor types. Plus, with must-see sights such as the Blue
          Lagoon and Golden Circle, close to Reykjav√≠k, it's ideal for
          both short breaks and longer getaways.
        </p>

          What's more, Iceland's temperate climate makes it a great
          year-round destination for visitors. In summer, the midnight
          sun means your guests can soak up even more stunning
          scenery, and in winter they could chase dazzling displays of
          the Northern Lights. Thanks to the warming effects of the
          Gulf Stream, Iceland enjoys temperate climates year round.
          Regardless of the season, you'll be warmly welcomed by
          Icelanders. We love to share our culture, and will make the
          extra efforts to ensure that your stay, much like the
          spectacular landscape, will never be forgotten.
